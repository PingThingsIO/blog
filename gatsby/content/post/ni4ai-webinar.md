Moderated by Prof. Sascha von Meier from UC Berkeley, this panel will introduce the ARPA-E funded NI4AI effort, built on PingThingsâ€™ PredictiveGrid platform. Use case examples involving different types of data analytics from academia and utility practice will highlight the role of geographic scope, heterogeneity, and real vs. synthetic data for creating new intelligence about the grid. Participants will have the opportunity to contribute comments and ideas about how this budding infrastructure can best serve their needs.

Panelists include Sean Murphy and Dr. Michael Andersen (CEO and CTO, PingThings), Mohini Bariya (UC Berkeley), Prof. Luigi Vanfretti and Dr. Tetiana Bogodorova (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and Dr. Kevin Jones (Dominion Energy).
