## About the data

The Sunshine dataset comes from a pilot program which installed six micro-PMUs on three distribution circuits. 
Each circuit was equipped with two PMUs, one at the substation and another located at either a generator or a load.
Table 1 describes the placement and connectivity of the sensors.

The data were collected as part of an early deployment of the micro-PMU, and gaps in the data correspond to time when the team was experimenting with different system configurations and wireless communications.


## Sensing infrastructure

Each PMU reports data at 120 frames per second on twelve channels: three-phase voltage and current, giving root-mean-square magnitude and phase angle for each.

The micro-PMU is specifically designed for distribution grid applications, and offers more precise GPS time stamping than most transmission PMUs.
Precise time stamping is important for distribution applications because the distances are not as large, and phase angle differences between measurement locations would be in the noise for a traditional PMU.
