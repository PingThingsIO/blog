The ASCE's [infrastructure report card](https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/energy/) gives grid infrastructure a D+. The low score is based on a few different factors:
- Infrastructure is overdue for replacement
- Systems are operating at or near capacity
- The grid is not ready to handle climate risks

ASCE estimates that the consequences of under-performance exceeded infrastructure investments by $177 billion in 2017. 

But these numbers do not tell the full story. Over 2000 utilities responded to the EIA's annual survey of the industry in 2019. 
While some of these utilities are under-investing, there are others who are ahead of the curve with regards to grid innovation.
In other words, the "investment gap" is not evenly distributed among these utilities.

Differences in size, ownership, regulation, and company culture mean that every utility has slightly different priorities. 
Best-practices for one utility may not work at all for another. 
Characteristics that distinguish each system or customer base may lead them to seek new solutions that the rest of the industry is not quite ready for.

We decided to dig into data collected via an annual survey of the industry administered by the EIA using "Form EIA-861" (data available [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/)).
We looked at 2019 data to explore what indicators we could use to identify utilities purusing innovative solutions.
We wanted to know: what differentiates the utilities that are leading the way?


## Show me the data

The survey asks utilities to report on metering technologies. The figure below is a histgram showing what fraction of utility customers have installed Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) capable of two-way communication. The figure shows that there are more utilities with AMI than there are without. We also note that the distribution is "bi-modal", indicating that utilities tend roll out AMI to all of their customers at once. This makes sense, as meters are installed primarily for billing efficiency. A partial deployment simply wouldn't achieve the same benefits.

Next, we looked at differences between utilities with and without high penetration of AMI. Below, we compare the two groups of utilities on the basis of size. We see that the utilities that have not yet rolled out AMI programs tend to be smaller than those that have. Of the 10 largest utilities surveyed, all but one have rolled out meters capable of two-way (AMI) or one-way (AMR) communications.

Finally, we examined differences among utilities with direct load control (DLC) programs. 
DLC allows grid operators to modify set-point temperatures for devices like air conditions and water heaters, or to shut them off entirely in response to conditions on the grid. 
The figure below shows that utilities with the highest customer participation in DLC programs tend to be small.

(Side note: The technology that enables DLC is distinct from AMI. Most utilities with high participation in DLC programs, however, have also rolled out AMI to most of their customers.)

## Who's setting the curve

Despite less R&D funding and less capacity for in-house analytics, our analysis shows that of the utilities that have the highest enrollment in DLC programs, the vast majority are munis and co-ops.

Municipal and co-operative ownership models also make these utilities more accountable to their customers. 
Smaller service territories mean they have fewer stakeholder groups to appease, and smaller organizational structures make it easier for successful ideas to propagate through different lines of business.

This means that smaller utilities tend to be more responsive to local needs and priorities than larger utilities. 
Where innovative solutions meet these needs better than legacy technologies, smaller utilities can afford to take risks that larger utilities would be hard pressed to do. 
We've found that munis and co-ops are setting the curve with regards to [decarbonization](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/holy-cross-energy-sets-new-70-clean-energy-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-goals-300715666.html), [grid automation](https://www.cooperative.com/remagazine/articles/pages/co-op-tech-advancing-the-self-healing-grid.aspx), and [distributed resource management](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/green-mountain-power-turnaround-driven-by-customer-obsession-cultural-shif/565031/).

Finally, studies have shown that *trust* plays an important role in consumer willingness to participate in such programs ([read more](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916315458)). 
We said earlier that greater accountability to customers means makes smaller utilities more responsive to customer needs, and the relationship goes both ways. 
When customers feel that their utility is responsive to their needs, they are more willing to make sacrifices for the betterment of their grid. 
Even minor changes in consumer behaviors can improve operational efficiency or reduce capital costs for utilities.
