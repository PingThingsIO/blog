    CHANGING END USES 
	  Shown below, applications for monitoring are also required due to the changing character of end-use loads. As we transition from things end uses like incandescent lighting the LEDs and battery storage, the dynamics of a wide-area grid can change drastically.  
	  
Changing end uses present challenges for the grid, since the grid was not necessarily build with these changes in mind. For example, incandescent lighting has transitioned to LED lighting. Most relevant recently, the auto industry is quickly transitioning from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric powered vehicles, which also require significant infrastructure that effects end uses. In conclusion, our grid requires modern solutions as a post hoc solution to changing end uses.
