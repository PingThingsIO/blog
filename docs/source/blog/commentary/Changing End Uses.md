#Changing End Uses


    CHANGING END USES 
	  Shown below, applications for monitoring are also required due to the changing character of end-use loads. As we transition from things end uses like incandescent lighting the LEDs and battery storage, the dynamics of a wide-area grid can change drastically.

Changing end uses refers to the change is the ways that electricity is used once it has gotten through distribution. For example, while we used to use incandescent light bulbs, LEDs are quickly becoming the norm. Similarly, automakers are switching from internal combustion engines to 
While our grid was not made with these changes in end uses in mind, it is now essential for utilities to understand the impact that they have on the grid.
