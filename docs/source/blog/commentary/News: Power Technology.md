PingThings, spearheading the NI4AI initiative was recently featured in leading publication [Power Technology](https://www.power-technology.com/analysis/modernising-us-grid-preparing-renewables-climate-change/). 

This article discusses how the bipartisan $1T infrastructure bill earmarks an incredible $27B for direct funding and borrowing authority to improve grid reliability. 

 Alexandra Sascha von Meier, director of the California Institute for Energy and Environment’s electric grid program states 'a ”complimentary” strategy could be to operate the grid in smaller sections' when enabled with proper data and sensor technology. 

We completely agree in this respect with Sascha. In addition to operating the grid more nimbly at the distribution level, NI4AI additionally supports preventative maintenance through its AI platform. 

Most importantly, by enabling data scientists and engineers to explore their data, this grid data revolution can progress more rapidly and ultimately increase resiliency in unforeseen ways.
